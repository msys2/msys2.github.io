# License

MSYS2 is a software distribution consisting of several independent parts, each with their own licenses, comparable to a Linux distribution.

The [installer](https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer), for example, is based on the [qt-installer-framework](https://packages.msys2.org/base/mingw-w64-qt-installer-framework) and pre-packs the direct and indirect dependencies of the [base](https://packages.msys2.org/package/base) meta package. Each package has its own licenses.

The "pacman" package manager in MSYS2 allows users to install [other packages](https://packages.msys2.org/base) available in our repository, each with their own licenses.

The license information for each package as visible on <https://packages.msys2.org> is maintained on a best effort basis and we make no guarantee that it is accurate or complete.
