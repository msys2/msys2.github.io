[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a text and source code editor.
It features syntax highlighting, code folding, terminal output window, and more.
To add the MSYS2 terminal profile in Sublime Text, please follow these steps:

* Install [Terminus package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Terminus) using
  Package Control.

* In the menu bar, select Preferences > Package Settings > Terminus > Settings
  option. This will open Terminus.sublime-settings file in separate Sublime Text
  window with two panes.

* In the right pane, add the following configuration for UCRT64.

* Change the command options as usual to use other terminal environments. If the
  Terminus.sublime-settings is not empty append the above section after others.

```json
{
  "shell_configs": [
    {
      "name": "UCRT64",
      "cmd": [
        "cmd.exe",
        "/c",
        "C:\\msys64\\msys2_shell.cmd -defterm -here -no-start -ucrt64"
      ],
      "env": {},
      "enable": true,
      "platforms": ["windows"]
    }
  ]
}
```

* Now the UCRT64 environment can be opened like any other shell in Sublime Text.
  Press Ctrl + Shift + P > Terminus: List shells > UCRT64 > Open in tab or pane.

## Visual Studio Code

Add these lines to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "terminal.integrated.profiles.windows": {
        "MSYS2 UCRT": {
            "path": "cmd.exe",
            "args": [
                "/c",
                "C:\\msys64\\msys2_shell.cmd -defterm -here -no-start -ucrt64"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Now the `MSYS2 UCRT` profile is available when launching a terminal.

## Zed

[Zed](https://zed.dev/) is a text and source code editor. Its syntax
highlighting and source parsing is based on tree-sitter library. Editor uses
GPU acceleration to have highest performance among other editors. Zed
package provides `zeditor` CLI installed under bin/ directory and `zed-editor`
executable installed under lib/zed/ directory. To use MSYS2 shell in integrated
terminal, press Ctrl + , to open settings, then put these lines in the opened
file. This is an example given for UCRT64 environment.

```json
{
  "terminal": {
    "shell": {
      "with_arguments": {
        "program": "cmd.exe",
        "args": ["/c", "C:\\msys64\\msys2_shell.cmd", "-defterm", "-here", "-no-start", "-ucrt64"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now UCRT64 shell will be opened if you press Ctrl + ~.

### AMD GPU support

Starting with v0.198.x, Zed uses DirectX GUI backend. For AMD GPUs users it's
highly recommended to install AMD AGS library to get fully featured support.
You may install it with this command:

```bash
curl --fail --location --output "$MINGW_PREFIX/lib/zed/amd_ags_x64.dll" https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/AGS_SDK/raw/v$VERSION/ags_lib/lib/amd_ags_x64.dll
```

$VERSION can be got from post upgrade message or from [upstream source](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Azed-industries%2Fzed+DownloadAMDGpuServices&type=code)
