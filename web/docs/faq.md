### How can I get MSYS2 running under Wine?

Wine fails to run Cygwin binaries and as a result MSYS2 and Git for Windows, which are based on Cygwin. See the following bug reports for the current state of things:

* https://github.com/msys2/MSYS2-packages/issues/682
* https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/3478
* https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40528

There exists [a wine fork with some MSYS2 specific
patches](https://gitlab.winehq.org/jhol/wine/-/commits/msys2-hacks-19) to make
things work and we provide an experimental Docker image using this fork at:
https://github.com/msys2/msys2-docker

It might require fixes in both Wine and Cygwin to get this issue fully resolved. If anyone makes some progress on this, let us know!

### How can I make MSYS2/pacman trust my company's/antivirus's custom TLS CA certificate

In case your computer is managed by an organization or by certain antivirus software (Avast and Norton are known to do this by default) they might MITM all your TLS connections and install their own custom CA certificate onto your system so that MITM connections are still marked as secure. Because OpenSSL in MSYS2 currently doesn't integrate with the Windows system CA store, and thus doesn't know about your organization's/antivirus's custom certificates, you have to add them and trust them manually.

You might be affected if you see the following errors when using pacman, curl or similar:

* `SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate`
* `SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain`
* `ERROR: The certificate of ‘<website>’ is not trusted.`
* `ERROR: The certificate of ‘<website>’ doesn't have a known issuer.`

First we need to get the certificates of your organization/antivirus

1) via Firefox:

* Open https://repo.msys2.org in Firefox (the connection should be marked as secure!)
* Press ctrl+i to open the page info
* Go to "Security" and click "View Certificate"
* Go through all tabs where the certificate belongs to your organization/antivirus, scroll down and click on "PEM (cert)" to download the "*.pem" file

2) or via Chrome/Chromium/Edge:

See https://stackoverflow.com/a/70398349

3) or by asking your IT department to give you the certificates.

Now that we have the certificate files, we copy them into MSYS2 and register them:

* Open a MSYS2 shell
* Place the .pem/.cer files into `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors`
* Run `update-ca-trust` (there is no output)

Now TLS connections to the MSYS2 repo should work:

```bash
$ curl --fail --silent --show-error -I https://repo.msys2.org -o /dev/null && echo "OK!"
OK!
```

The certificates can be removed again by deleting the .pem/.cer files in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors` and running `update-ca-trust` again.

In case your TLS connections are intercepted by an antivirus, you can also turn off this functionality in the antivirus to fix the issue. This can make your computer more vulnerable, the solution described above should therefore be preferred. Instructions on how to turn this off for Avast antivirus can be found [here](https://support.avast.com/en-us/article/use-antivirus-https-scan/#pc). Other antivirus software which intercepts TLS connections may require similar steps to fix the issue.

### How long are old packages kept on repo.msys2.org?

1.75 years after a package version leaves the pacman package database, it is removed from the server. This means that if you do not update the pacman DB for more than 1.75 years, the installation of packages may fail until you update.

External projects that rely on specific package versions on the repo server are advised to mirror those packages if the above retention policy does not meet their needs.

### What does "magic number mismatch detected" mean?

msys2 is a fork of cygwin and uses a pinned memory address to allow coordination between different executables running in the same environment. This memory format is determined by a "magic number" header at the top of the pinned memory address to ensure that corrupted memory is not read. While having multiple copies of the msys2 dll running at the same time is not necessarily a problem, what is a problem is having multiple versions that write different versions to the same space (or if that pinned memory gets rebased and accessed in a wrong way).

For this reason, the following scenarios can cause a address memory mismatch:

1. Address randomization being turned on for the initial program or dll
2. A program loading multiple versions of msys2 with mismatched magic numbers
3. A program loading multiple versions of msys2 and forcing the dll to be address rebased
4. A separate program loading msys2 in

Since a lot of command line tools pack msys2 with them to provide a nice operating scenario then you may need to make sure that these are aligned correctly. For this reason, make sure to be using compatible versions of msys2 with other components

### My antivirus flagged an MSYS2 file as malicious, what should I do?

Since antivirus software is prone to false positives and MSYS2 contains many
binaries that can trigger such false positives, and antivirus software typically
doesn't provide detailed information about why a specific file is flagged, there
is usually not much we can do.

Still, feel free to open a GitHub issue or contact us about the detection - this
helps us track widespread issues. There are a few things we can do to help:

* We will upload the file to https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload to see
  how widespread the issue is and track its status. In many cases only a few
  vendors detect a specific issue, and some vendors use the same detection
  engine internally.
* Some antivirus vendors provide forms to report false positives where we can
  upload the affected files so they can adjust their heuristics.

If you have any additional proof of a malicious file, besides an antivirus
report, please let us know and we will investigate further.
