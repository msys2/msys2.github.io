It consists of a command line terminal called mintty , bash, version control systems like git and subversion, tools like tar and awk and even build systems like autotools, all based on a modified version of Cygwin . Despite some of these central parts being based on Cygwin, the main focus of MSYS2 is to provide a build environment for native Windows software and the Cygwin-using parts are kept at a minimum. MSYS2 provides up-to-date native builds for GCC, mingw-w64, CPython, CMake, Meson, OpenSSL, FFmpeg, Rust, Ruby, just to name a few. To provide easy installation of packages and a way to keep them updated it features a package management system called Pacman , which should be familiar to Arch Linux users. It brings many powerful features such as dependency resolution and simple complete system upgrades, as well as straight-forward and reproducible package building. Our package repository contains more than 2600 pre-built packages ready to install. For more details see 'What is MSYS2?' which also compares MSYS2 to other software distributions and development environments like Cygwin , WSL , Chocolatey , Scoop , ... and 'Who Is Using MSYS2?' to see which projects are using MSYS2 and what for. Installation Download the installer: msys2-x86_64-20221028.exe Verify with SHA256 checksum 9ab223bee2610196ae8e9c9e0a2951a043cac962692e4118ad4d1e411506cd04 or GPG signature by 0xf7a49b0ec . Run the installer. MSYS2 requires 64 bit Windows 7 or newer. Enter your desired Installation Folder (short ASCII-only path on a NTFS volume, no accents, no spaces, no symlinks, no subst or network drives, no FAT). When done, click Finish . Now MSYS2 is ready for you and a terminal for the UCRT64 environment will launch.

Now that all our packages are available in this new environment and a very large percentage of our users (~97%) are on a system that includes UCRT, we recommend it as the default environment instead of MINGW64. The MINGW32/64 environments will continue to exist and there are no plans to remove them, but we will focus our attention more on UCRT64 and the other UCRT-using environments such as CLANG64 and CLANGARM64. 2022-10-23 - mingw packages now built with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 and -fstack-protector-strong Our mingw packages will be built with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 and -fstack-protector-strong from now on. 2022-10-18 - New minimum hardware requirements (CPUs from ~2006/7+) As a first step of phasing out support for Windows 7, we're raising the minimum hardware requirements to match Windows 8.1, which roughly equals Intel Core 2 / AMD Phenom, so anything after 2006/7 is fine. In terms of GCC/Clang compiler flags this means going from -march=x86-64 to -march=nocona -msahf . This only affects 64bit packages, and only those that use features only available in those newer CPUs, and only once they are updated or rebuilt. 2022-10-10 - libssp is no longer required Building with _FORTIFY_SOURCE no longer requires explicitly linking with libssp (-lssp) and enabling stack protection no longer pulls in libssp. This brings things in line with other platforms. Thanks to Martin Storsj\u00f6 for implementing this in mingw-w64. Once all our affected packages are rebuilt we will remove the libssp package from our repo. 2022-10-13: We have decided to keep just the libssp DLL around for some more time to avoid breaking existing users 2022-09-24 - Changed behavior for empty env vars Empty environment variables are no longer removed when starting a new non-cygwin process. $ FOO = python -c \"import os; print('FOO' in os.environ)\" # Old False $ FOO = python -c \"import os; print('FOO' in os.environ)\" # New True You can revert to the old behavior by setting MSYS=noemptyenvvalues . Please let us know if this is breaking anything that can't be solved by just unsetting the env var where needed. 2022-09-24 - ConPTY support enabled by default ConPTY support in our cygwin fork is now enabled by default. This means any non-cygwin apps will now behave as if they are run in with a console attached and not redirected. This feature has been enabled in upstream cygwin for quite a while but we wanted to wait until there are no more known issues. We now feel that not enabling it causes more problems then enabling it. You can disable it again by setting MSYS=disable_pcon . 2022-04-06 - Windows 7 / 8 support will be dropped late 2022 or early 2023 Cygwin 3.5 will drop support for Windows <8.1, which means the new requirement will be \"64 bit Windows 8.1 / Windows Server 2012 R2\". We expect the update to Cygwin 3.5 to be around late 2022, early 2023. For more information, look here . A recent survey suggests that ~2-3% of our active users (excluding cloud servers and CI systems) are still using Windows <8.1. We recommend them stopping to update at the end of the year. We've enabled an inline warning message for them when they open a terminal. For developers bundling our packages, we recommend simply pointing out the last version of their application that still worked with Windows 7 / 8 on their download page. 2022-03-04 - Sunsetting the SourceForge mirror in 30 days from now Note: This should only affect systems not updated in over a year, or users that actively switched to this mirror, which is unlikely. Due to space constrains and our ever growing package archive we can no longer update the SourceForge mirror . We already hit the space limit last year but worked around it by no longer syncing source packages. We have now hit the limit again, and decided that it is no longer worth it maintaining it. We will remove the SourceForge mirror on 2022-04-03 . We will delete the package databases as well to make DB syncs fail to avoid users using outdated software without them knowing it. After 4 more weeks we will delete the remaining packages and installers. 2022-05-07 : The mirror has now been removed. 2022-02-24 - repo.msys2.org only available via HTTPS/TLS We have switched repo.msys2.org to always redirect to a secure connection. If for some reason you require HTTP you can use one of our tier 1 mirrors . 2021-12-22 - Ongoing Cleanup of the base-devel Package Group The base-devel package group is the set of packages required to be installed before running makepkg / makepkg-mingw . We have recently started to clean this group up and moved some of the packages to be explicit dependencies in the PKGBUILD files instead. One notable removal is various autotools related packages. There now exists an autotools and a ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-autotools meta package which will pull in anything related to autotools which packages can add to their makedepends . Further more the group was replaced with a package of the same name, to make adding/removing packages easier. Note that pacman prefers packages over groups for the same name, so the set of included packages is now listed here https://packages.msys2.org/package/base-devel This cleanup can lead to build errors in case your build setup assumes certain packages being installed with base-devel . If that is the case make sure to install those missing packages explicitly instead. 2021-12-21 - Potential Incompatibilities with newer Python setuptools tl;dr: use export SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=stdlib if you have problems building/installing packages with newer versions of setuptools from pypi. The Python packaging ecosystem is currently in the transition of removing distutils from CPython and moving it into setuptools. Historically distutils is patched quite a bit by us to make it work with our directory layout and to build packages with gcc/clang instead of MSVC. With this move our patches are no longer used and setuptools will fail in various ways, or install things into wrong places. We are working with upstream to include our patches, but this will take some more time. In the meantime you can force setuptools to use the (still patched) distutils from the CPython stdlib via export SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=stdlib The setuptools version in our repo however will continue to use the patched distutils until all issues are resolved and is not affected. \ud83d\ude4f Many thanks to the distutils and setuptools maintainers for considering our patches, despite Cygwin/MSYS2 not being officially supported by CPython. 2021-10-14 - OpenSSH 8.8 dropped support for old ssh-rsa keys using SHA-1 The recent OpenSSH update disabled support for old ssh-rsa keys using SHA-1 by default. See https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.8 \"Potentially-incompatible changes\" for details and possible workarounds. 2021-07-04 - Some Mirror/Server/Repository Changes Primary Pacman Server : We've switched the main server in the pacman config to https://mirror.msys2.org . This server will redirect pacman to an up-to-date mirror near you for each file. We hope this will improve the download speed for users further away from Europe. We also have a new overview of all mirrors here . Repo Path Renaming: We've renamed mingw/i686/ to mingw/mingw32/ and mingw/x86_86/ to mingw/mingw64/ and added symlinks for the old paths. This means 100GB of resyncing for mirrors using rsync (sorry :/). Having the repo name in the directory path allows us to have one mirrorlist configuration for all repos in the future. Sourceforge : Due to space constraints we no longer host the source packages on Sourceforge. They are still available on our main server and on all mirrors. 2021-04-21 - R.I.P. mingwandroid Ray Donnelly is a co-founder and developer of MSYS2 and after a multi year fight with cancer passed away on 2021-04-20. If you want to know more about his life and work see his fundraiser descriptions: https://uk.gofundme.com/f/help-Ray-fund-a-hospice-bedroom https://uk.gofundme.com/f/arku72-help-ray-fight-cancer He was always helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly, and he will be greatly missed. 2021-03-25 - Temporarily broken msys2-launcher package The repo contained a broken msys2-launcher package for a few hours today causing things like \"msys2.exe\" to just show an error dialog. You can get back to a working setup this way: Start C:/msys64/msys2_shell.cmd to get a shell Run pacman -Suy to get all the fixed packages 2021-02-27 - New server for repo.msys2.org and packages.msys2.org We have moved repo.msys2.org (and package.msys2.org) to a new server. There was a short downtime, but everything should be running great now. Big thanks to appfleet.com jsdelivr.com for sponsoring the new server. New mirrorlists for Pacman will be published soon. After you get them, your package installs and updates should be faster than before and without the 404s and glitches. With the migration, Christoph (@lazka) will now be updating and signing the Pacman databases more often. This should go smoothly as the GPG keys are already in place and the process has been tested on the new server before it went live. By the way, the redirect domain msys2.org (no www.) should work more reliably now and HTTPS is now available for it. 2021-01-31 - ASLR enabled by default About 5 months ago we started backporting patches to our binutils 2.35 to allow enabling ASLR support via various flags.

This also installs the pacman-contrib package where updpkgsums , pactree etc. now live (previously included in the pacman package).

You can stop them by running the following in a Windows terminal: taskkill /f /fi \"MODULES eq msys-2.0.dll\" If that fails, try a reboot. We've improved our update process so this shouldn't happen again with future updates. 2020-05-22 - Pacman may fail to install packages with Unrecognized archive format For a while, the core packages were prematurely packaged using zstd without giving users time to update to zstd-enabled pacman first. This should be resolved now. 2020-05-17 - 32-bit MSYS2 no longer actively supported 32-bit mingw-w64 packages are still supported, this is about the POSIX emulation layer, i.e. the runtime, Bash, MinTTY... After this date, we don't plan on building updated msys-i686 packages nor releasing i686 installers anymore.

Fill out your PKGBUILD file See https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD for details on the format and the meaning of variables and functions. See our Package Guidelines for how we expect PKGBUILD files to be structured and how they should behave. Run updpkgsums to update the source checksums in the PKGBUILD file. Build the package... Building the package Building a package requires a base set of build related packages to be installed first. This only needs to be done once: pacman -S --needed base-devel To build the package, start a shell in an environment you want to build for, change the working directory to the directory of the PKGBUILD , and run: makepkg-mingw --cleanbuild --syncdeps --force --noconfirm This will download all required build dependencies, build your package, and will result in a *.pkg.tar.zst package in the same directory, if nothing goes wrong. To install the package you can run: pacman -U *.pkg.tar.zst makepkg-mingw has various other helpful options you can add: --install - to install the built package right away --rmdeps - to remove all packages again that it installed for building --help - to see more options Proposing the package to be included in our official repository Once you are pleased with your package and have tested it sufficiently you can create a pull request against our package repository \u2192 https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pulls Once the PR is opened, our CI system will try to build your package in a fresh and clean build environment and will also try to build it for all our supported target environments (mingw64, clang64, etc). There is a chance that this will uncover some issues in your package, such as unspecified build dependencies, or uncover errors in projects that build with gcc but not with clang for example. If that is the case you can try to fix the found issues or ask us for assistance. Differences compared to Arch Linux If you are already accustomed to building packages for Arch Linux, you might notice some differences despite us using the same tools: Our PKGBUILD files use environment variables such as MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX and MINGW_PREFIX in various places so they can be used to build packages for difference environments using the same PKGBUILD file. We use makepkg-mingw instead of makepkg . makepkg-mingw is just a small wrapper around makepkg which sets up the right environment and also allows building the same package multiple times for different environments in one go.","title":"Creating a new Package"},{"location":"dev/new-package/#creating-a-new-package","text":"A package consists of a package recipe in the form of a PKGBUILD file.

How can I make MSYS2/pacman trust my company's custom TLS CA certificate In case your computer is managed by an organization they might MITM all your TLS connections and install their own custom CA certificate onto your system so that MITM connections are still marked as secure.

When building things the paths of input and output files and directories are often communicated between them via process arguments or environment variables. The problem here is that those are in many cases not compatible: C:\\nope is not a valid Unix path and \\n might make problems when being interpreted as an escape sequence. C:/nope is slightly better, because, while it's not a valid Unix path, if it's just forwarded to some other Windows tools things might work out fine. /foo is both a valid Windows path (drive relative path evaluating to C:\\foo for example) and a valid Unix path, but resolves to a different path. Again, if it's just forwarded to some other Unix tool then things might work out fine. foo/bar.txt just works, relative to the current working directory, while foo\\bar.txt is only OK with native tools. Path lists, commonly used in environment variables like FOO=/foo:/bar also will never work, since paths are separated by ; on Windows and not : , similarly c:/foo could be interpreted as a Unix path list containing c and /foo when a path list is expected. The only solution here is to avoid mixing Unix/Cygwin and native tools outside of makepkg (preferred) or convert them when they get passed between the different programs. For the latter MSYS2 provides an automatic conversion that just works automatically in many cases. Manual Unix \u27f7 Windows Path Conversion MSYS2 ships the Cygwin tool cygpath by default which allows converting paths between the Unix format, Windows format, and mixed format, see cygpath --help for details. $ cygpath -u C: \\\\ foo /c/foo $ cygpath -m /mingw64/bin C:/msys64/mingw64/bin $ cygpath -w /mingw64/bin C: \\m sys64 \\m ingw64 \\b in Automatic Unix \u27f6 Windows Path Conversion Process Arguments When calling native executables from the context of Cygwin then all the arguments that look like Unix paths will get auto converted to Windows. For example when calling native Python from the context of bash: $ python3 -c \"import sys; print(sys.argv)\" --dir = /foo [ '-c' , '--dir=C:/msys64/foo' ] $ python3 -c \"import sys; print(sys.argv)\" --dir = /foo:/bla [ '-c' , '--dir=C:\\\\msys64\\\\foo;C:\\\\msys64\\\\bla' ] While this is helpful in many cases it's also not perfect and in corner cases converts arguments that look like Unix paths while they are not, or detects lists of Unix paths where there are none. For these cases you can exclude certain arguments via the MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL environment variable: $ MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL = '--dir=' python3 -c \"import sys; print(sys.argv)\" --dir = /foo [ '-c' , '--dir=/foo' ] MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL can either be * to mean exclude everything, or a list of one or more arguments prefixes separated by ; , like MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL=--dir=;--bla=;/test . It matches the prefix against the whole argument string. Environment Variables Similar to process arguments, paths in environment variables get converted too: $ MYVAR = /foo python3 -c \"import os; print(os.environ['MYVAR'])\" C:/msys64/foo $ MYVAR = /foo:/bar python3 -c \"import os; print(os.environ['MYVAR'])\" C: \\m sys64 \\f oo ; C: \\m sys64 \\b ar You can disable the conversion with MSYS2_ENV_CONV_EXCL : $ MSYS2_ENV_CONV_EXCL='MYVAR' MYVAR=/foo python3 -c \"import os; print(os.environ['MYVAR'])\" /foo MSYS2_ENV_CONV_EXCL can either be * to mean exclude everything, or a list of one or more environment variable prefixes separated by ; , like MSYS2_ENV_CONV_EXCL=FOO;BAR;/test . It matches the prefix against the following string KEY=VALUE . Cygwin special cases some environment variables that are known to be paths or path lists and does less guessing with them. For example HOME will never be interpreted as a path list even if it contains : . Windows \u27f6 Unix Path Conversion You might wonder why calling things like ls C:/ might work and suspect that again auto conversion is used, but that's not the case: $ /usr/bin/python3 -c \"import sys, os; print(sys.argv, os.listdir(sys.argv[1]))\" C:/ [ '-c' , 'C:/' ] [ '$Recycle.Bin' , '$SysReset' , ... ] Cygwin which provides the POSIX API will just forward the paths to the Windows API as is. This works as long as the tool does not try to interpret the path too much and just forwards it to the system API. If that doesn't work in your case you can use cygpath : $ /usr/bin/python3 -c \"import sys, os; print(sys.argv, os.listdir(sys.argv[1]))\" \" $( cygpath -u C:/ ) \" [ '-c' , '/c/' ] [ '$Recycle.Bin' , '$SysReset' , ... ] The package prefix (hack) When looking at some of our package recipes you might have seen something like: MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL = \"--prefix=\" \\ meson \\ --prefix = \" ${ MINGW_PREFIX } \" \\ ... which results in meson --prefix=/mingw64 ... being executed. /mingw64 in this case is the UNIX prefix where the package will be installed to and in addition is a valid Windows path (a drive relative path, so C:\\mingw64 ), so the native build tools will concatenate it with DESTDIR and copy things to the right place. In the native Windows world this path doesn't make much sense, as C:\\mingw64 likely doesn't match where the software lives, but ideally all native Windows tools are relocatable and won't use the prefix at runtime anyway.

Packages in MSYS2 work like packages in popular Linux distributions. A package is an archive containing a piece of software. This normally means executable files, runtime libraries, data, shared and static link libraries, header files, config files, and manual pages. Packages also contain metadata, such as the software's name, description of its purpose, version number, vendor, checksum, and a list of dependencies necessary for the software to run properly. Upon installation, the files contained are extracted into your MSYS2 installation directory and the metadata are stored in a local database. There are 6 package repositories, the \"classical\" ones msys2 , mingw32 , and mingw64 and the newer ucrt64 , clang32 , and clang64 . The packages in msys2 are named just like on a Linux distribution, the packages in the others are prefixed by either mingw-w64-i686- for 32-bit packages, or mingw-w64-x86_64- for 64-bit packages with a secondary prefix clang or ucrt where applicable. For more details about those see 'Environments' and ' Package Naming' . Finding a package If you want to find a specific package in the repository (and that package can or cannot be installed on your machine) you can use the following command: pacman -Ss <name or part of the name of the package> Example: $ pacman -Ss openjp mingw32 / mingw - w64 - i686 - openjpeg 1.5.2 - 7 An open source JPEG 2000 codec ( mingw - w64 ) mingw32 / mingw - w64 - i686 - openjpeg2 2.1.0 - 7 An open source JPEG 2000 codec ( mingw - w64 ) mingw64 / mingw - w64 - x86_64 - openjpeg 1.5.2 - 7 An open source JPEG 2000 codec ( mingw - w64 ) mingw64 / mingw - w64 - x86_64 - openjpeg2 2.1.0 - 7 [ installed ] An open source JPEG 2000 codec ( mingw - w64 ) As you can see the mingw-w64-x86_64-openjpeg2 package is installed, while the mingw-w64-x86_64-openjpeg package is not installed. If you would like to search only among the packages which has been already installed, use the following command: pacman -Qs <name or part of the name of the package> Installing a package If you want to install a package, use the following command: pacman -S <name of the package> If the package has dependencies which are not installed, pacman will ask you whether you would like to install the dependencies in the first place. pacman -S also accepts virtual package names and package group names. Virtual package names can be often encountered with packages built from Git, e.g. msys2-launcher-git can be installed by requesting msys-launcher . Package groups simplify installation of related packages, e.g. install base-devel to get basic development tools. Please note that neither of those are real packages, so the commands below won't accept these names and you need to use the real package names instead. Uninstalling a package The following command will remove a package (but not its dependencies nor any files produced by running it): pacman -R <name of the package> Installing a specific version of a package or a stand-alone packages Older (or pre-release) versions of packages can be installed directly from the package archive ( .tar.zst or .tar.xz ). The data store for the repositories contains older versions of packages, but beware that you might need to recursively find correct versions of dependencies for the desired package. Once downloaded, the package can be installed like this: pacman -U <packagefile.tar.zst> or pacman -U <packagefile.tar.xz> Finding dependencies of a package You can use pactree to figure out which packages are needed to make a package working properly: $ pactree mingw-w64-x86_64-gettext mingw-w64-x86_64-gettext \u251c\u2500mingw-w64-x86_64-expat \u251c\u2500mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-libs \u2502 \u251c\u2500mingw-w64-x86_64-gmp \u2502 \u251c\u2500mingw-w64-x86_64-libwinpthread-git provides mingw-w64-x86_64-libwinpthread \u2502 \u2514\u2500mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-libgfortran \u2502 \u2514\u2500mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-libs \u2514\u2500mingw-w64-x86_64-libiconv Alternatively you can use pacman -Qi to get the list of direct dependencies of a package: $ pacman -Qi mingw-w64-x86_64-gettext Name : mingw-w64-x86_64-gettext Version : 0.19.7-1 Description : GNU internationalization library (mingw-w64) [...] Depends On : mingw-w64-x86_64-expat mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-libs mingw-w64-x86_64-libiconv Finding out which package a file belongs to Use the following command to trace a file back to its owning package: pacman -Qo <full file path> Note that this operation only compares the file paths, so proper capitalization and the .exe suffix (if applicable) is required. Also note that this works only on installed packages, it will not scan the whole package repositories. Finding which package will install the file you need The two recommended tools that can scan a repository and find packages that contain specific files are pacman -F and pkgfile . Below are examples of pacman -F usage: Call pacman -Fy to update your package database. To find an exact match, call pacman -F <filename> (don't include the path in the filename). To find a substring match, call pacman -Fx <filename> . Note that this operation only compares the file paths, so proper capitalization and the .exe suffix (if applicable) is required.

General information There are 3 package repositories, msys , mingw32 , and mingw64 . msys software (from the msys repository) is software that depends on msys-2.0.dll and is very similar to Cygwin software (which is a POSIX emulation layer for Windows). Native Windows software (from this project's perspective) is software that doesn't depend on msys-2.0.dll , and links dynamically to the highly compatible msvcrt.dll . In this document, to attempt to avoid confusion, MSYS2 refers to the software distribution while msys refers to the repository, the packages in that repository and the software in those packages that link to msys-2.0.dll . Package recipes Packages are built from programmatic recipes to ensure builds are reproducible. A recipe is a set of files which describe how to build, package and install a given piece of software; these are often specific to MSYS2. In the simplest form it is a single file named PKGBUILD , which contains metadata for the package, a specification where the source for the given software can be found, and a few lines of code which that takes the source and builds the final software from it. For more complex cases it also contains install scripts or a number of patch files which are needed to be applied on the released version of the upstream software in order to be able to compile and work in the given environment. Typically, each recipe is in its own directory. The directory is also used when building as a working place by default. PKGBUILD Use 2 spaces for indentation: expand -t 2 PKGBUILD > PKGBUILD.new && mv PKGBUILD.new PKGBUILD A PKGBUILD is a bash script defining variables and functions that are then used by the build system to create the package. The PKGBUILD manpage and the PKGBUILD wikipage on ArchWiki are good sources to read about all the details of PKGBUILDs. The mingw PKGBUILDs are loosely based on the mingw-w64 cross-compilation packages guidelines in Arch Linux . If you don't want to read all that just yet, just read some existing PKGBUILDs; the purpose of most parts should be obvious. Patch files When creating a patch file, you can use the following naming convention for its name: ###-target-Purpose.patch Where ### a sequence number, starting from 001 target , is the package name and version (separated by a hyphen) for which the patch was first created [Purpose] describes what the patch is fixing or improving Building The actual build and packaging is done by running makepkg or makepkg-mingw . The former is used to build msys packages and the latter for mingw packages. To learn more, read the makepkg manpage and the makepkg wikipage on ArchWiki . When building either msys or native software, you should use the MSYS shell, not the MINGW{32,64} shells. The process happens in multiple phases: download, verify and extract - the package sources are downloaded if necessary, checked against checksums and PGP signatures if specified, and extracted into a working directory ( src by default) prepare() - using this function, the packager can specify what should happen with the sources before the actual build; apply patches and source modifications here build() - this function contains commands to run the build tool(s), e.g. ./configure and make check() - an optional step to check the build products by e.g. running the software's test suite package() - this function is provided with a temporary directory, where it should put the final contents of the package using e.g. make install tidy, archive and sign - the package contents are scanned for some issues, tidied up and packaged into the final .tar.zst with an optional signature in .tar.zst.sig The makepkg tool takes arguments allowing you to turn off some phases or some checks. The typical usage is makepkg -sCLf for a full build and makepkg -RdLf for a \"re-package\". Re-packaging is useful when the process failed in package() and you don't want to run the long build part again. makepkg-mingw takes the same arguments. Re-building a package To get you started, you can try just re-building an existing package. This may also be helpful if you need to diagnose an issue and need the debugging symbols. An example of fetching the msys repository source, building and then installing a package from it is: git clone \"https://github.com/msys2/MSYS2-packages\" cd MSYS2-packages/flex makepkg -sCLf pacman -U flex-*.pkg.tar.zst An example of fetching the mingw repository source, building and then installing a package from it is: git clone \"https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages\" cd MINGW-packages/mingw-w64-python3 makepkg-mingw -sCLf pacman -U mingw-w64-*-python3-*-any.pkg.tar.zst A new package from start to finish Please do not create pull requests for PKGBUILDs that just repackage binary releases from other projects. This is contrary to the goals of MSYS2. If the software cannot be built for some reason then try to fix the cause of that. Decide which subsystem to target ( msys or mingw ) Build the software in the target subsystem Test the functionality Create patches if necessary and repeat Prepare a recipe Build the package Install the package locally Test the installed package Modify the recipe if necessary and repeat Commit the new package to the target repository (on your own GitHub account) Send a pull request to merge the new recipe into the official repository Check CI results, reviews and comments Fix issues if necessary and repeat Offer your fixes to the software's developers (upstream) The steps above describe an intuitive process of going from the idea of creating a package to making it available to you and others using pacman . You can of course customize the process to suit you and your situation. Once you are familiar with the process, we recommend creating recipes and using makepkg straight away for all packages. It's a great way to record your build steps in a reproducible way, which is not only useful for you, but also for other people when asked for help with the builds. Which subsystem? In MSYS2 there are 2 types of packages: msys packages - these run on the emulation layer and are typically POSIX-only programs mingw packages - these run natively just like any other Windows program You should think of these two systems as separate where msys packages should generally only be build dependencies of mingw packages. You also can't link a mingw program against an msys library. This means you first need to decide which subsystem (and which repository) is the right one for your new package. The set of things that belong to the msys subsystem is pretty small: essential POSIX stuff: filesystem , msys2-runtime , ... the native toolchain: gcc , binutils , gdb , ... supporting programs that are hard to port to Windows: pacman , bash , automake , make , ... programs for bridging the gap: mintty , winpty , ... supporting programs, even though they're portable: python , man , vim , git , ... carefully chosen useful tools: mc , ssh , rsync , lftp , ... dependencies of these packages In other words, if a program is needed to build native software, but is itself hard to port, it can be made into an msys package. Anything else needs to be done as a mingw package or vetted individually. Build software In order to be able to compile a software or build a package you need to install basic packages by installing base-devel , as the MSYS2 install does not contain build tools. If you don't install the required package, building might fail with unexpected errors. Note that -- contrary to what you might expect -- base-devel doesn't contain gcc nor binutils . Test software Check that the software does what it should. Try its test suite. Patch software If the software doesn't work straight away or doesn't even build, you'll probably need to pass some arguments to the build scripts or modify (patch) its build system, its source code, its definitions files etc. Such patches will be stored as files alongside the PKGBUILD. This part is very specific to each software and may require searching the Internet, talking to the software's developers or support team, talking to us etc. The Porting wikipage may help with some common issues. While it is probably okay to make quick (monkey-)patches that fix the software for our use case (and possibly break it for every other), is it better to make proper surgical-precision patches and attempt to have them accepted by the software developer (\"upstream\"). Recipe Create a PKGBUILD describing all the steps necessary to build and package the software, including any patches or additional files. Make sure the follow the style and ideas of other recipes if applicable. A good strategy is to find some existing working recipes that use the same build system as your software does and use them as a template for your recipe. You can also take inspiration from an official Arch Linux (or unofficial AUR) recipe for your software. Build package Run the makepkg command ( makepkg or makepkg-mingw ) on your recipe. makepkg-mingw is essentially a wrapper that does a few checks, sets up the correct environments and runs makepkg twice, once for mingw32 and once for mingw64 . If you want to build just for one architecture (e.g. if you're on 32-bit Windows), you'll need to define MINGW_ARCH in the environment, with either mingw32 or mingw64 as the value, for example: MINGW_ARCH=mingw64 makepkg-mingw -sCLf ... or you could export it from ~/.profile so it's set up automatically: export MINGW_ARCH = mingw64 Note that if you want to contribute, we'd appreciate it if you test your packages on both architectures (32 and 64 bits), which is only possible on a 64-bit Windows system. If you can't do that for some reason, we can test your pull requests on a 64-bit system. Install package If the package build successfully, it's good to check its contents first before installing to see if it contains what you intended. When installing (using pacman -U pkgname-pkgver-arch.tar.zst ), pacman checks for any filesystem conflicts and then places the package contents into your MSYS2 root as it would do with any other package. You can also remove the package using pacman -R pkgname . Test package Make sure the package installed all the files which it's supposed to distribute: executables, shared and static libraries, configuration files, header files, licenses, documentation etc. Pay special attention to the configuration files and make sure they are not containing hard-coded path elements and are pointing to the right location. Typical config files: *-config files in the ${prefix}/bin directory *.pc files for pkg-config in the ${prefix}/lib/pkgconfig directory *.cmake files in the ${prefix}/lib/cmake directory Verify that the package works even if installed into a clean updated MSYS2 installation, preferably not in the default C:\\msys{32,64} location (and maybe even temporarily rename your primary MSYS2 installation root). This checks that you specified the runtime dependencies correctly and that the software doesn't try to use hard-coded paths from your build. Modify package If there are issues, fix them in your PKGBUILD and re-build or re-package as necessary. Make sure you're not using stale build products or source files from a previous build (use the -C flag for makepkg). Commit Integrate your recipe into your local clone of the msys2-packages or mingw-packages repository. In order to help us avoid accumulating useless commits in the repository, please follow these guidelines: create a new branch for your work put all your work into it, preferably in just 1 commit if you want to pull changes from our repository, use the rebasing strategy ( git pull --rebase ) to place your commits above ours, do not just merge if you need to change something in your recipe, amend your existing commit ( git commit --amend ) push your new branch onto your repository \"fork\" on your GitHub account, using git push --force-with-lease if necessary Although these guidelines (which rely heavily on rewriting history) are not suitable for public development on main branches ( master etc.), they're an excellent match for this kind the iterative work-in-progress development that happens when contributing new packages. Send PR Open and send a pull request against the master branch of the official repositories on GitHub ( links here ). Please include a short description of what you're submitting and why. In case your recipe is not final yet, add \"[do not merge]\" to the title and explain in the description. Check Our CI systems will automatically try to build your package. If it fails, try to figure out why. However, the CI systems are not perfect and unfortunately may fail even if your package is fine. The project maintainers will try to look at your PR and review it. This may take some time and sometimes happens in bursts, so don't be discouraged if you get no response for a few days, but don't be afraid to explicitly ask for help or a review on our IRC channel. Fix If there are any issues pointed out, try to fix them and update your pull request. GitHub will automatically refresh the pull request when you push to your branch, there is no need to create a new PR. After pushing, add a comment to the PR to notify the reviewers. If there are no issues with the package, it will be merged. Please note that this doesn't make the package immediately available through pacman. The binary repositories are updated in bursts. Upstream In case you had to made changes in order to be able to compile and run properly (and hence created patches), please make an effort to submit proper patches and PRs to the upstream project so that the patches can be removed from our repositories and can be of use to other Windows developers.

The process happens in multiple phases: download, verify and extract - the package sources are downloaded if necessary, checked against checksums and PGP signatures if specified, and extracted into a working directory ( src by default) prepare() - using this function, the packager can specify what should happen with the sources before the actual build; apply patches and source modifications here build() - this function contains commands to run the build tool(s), e.g. ./configure and make check() - an optional step to check the build products by e.g. running the software's test suite package() - this function is provided with a temporary directory, where it should put the final contents of the package using e.g. make install tidy, archive and sign - the package contents are scanned for some issues, tidied up and packaged into the final .tar.zst with an optional signature in .tar.zst.sig The makepkg tool takes arguments allowing you to turn off some phases or some checks.

Each goal should be described in appropriate detail and should be broken up into smaller tasks for interested members to tackle the goal step by step. Finish the SourceForge migration triage/migrate tickets from SF to GH; close them on SF afterwards archive the (closed) mailing list maybe? see mbox export Streamline automation for the package review/build/upload process write down packaging rules (rules inherited from Arch Linux, rules about pkgbase , pkgname , description , FHS, 32+64 bits, ...) prepare automated checks to prevent mistakes (an idea: compare package file list between latest and new version of the package) also work towards reproducible builds ( https://reproducible-builds.org/ ) don't build for mingw32 in CI if the package doesn't support it etc. Official release MSYS2 is quite known but it's not obvious e.g. how stable and reliable it's supposed to be. People are sometimes confusing it (in their minds, or in their words, or both) with MSys, much like MinGW-w64 is confused with MinGW.org. The naming clash of MSYS2 the distribution vs. msys2 the emulation layer is also unfortunate (again reminiscent of the MinGW-w64 projects vs. its distributions). What to do: decide if there's a need for a different name for the whole thing ; if yes, decide upon one split release Qt runtime from debug Qt runtime and Qt developer files (those debug and dev files are really huge) make core updates fool-proof maybe approve and polish one graphical front-end to pacman create and/or polish packages for most popular open-source software (browsers, video players, email clients, office suites, IDEs, web servers) and maybe some additional useful software (like password managers, games, image editors) Merge with Cygwin The MSYS2 runtime is forked from Cygwin and the code bases are irregularly (but often) synchronized. There has been some talk about modifying Cygwin to make it pluggable so that the MSYS2 runtime can be reduced to a plugin DLL that will make all the desired behavior changes. There have been a lot of requests for additional POSIX-only software in MSYS2 (X, various daemons...) and the response was always \"MSYS2 is not for you; use Cygwin\". It would be nice if people could just install one POSIX emulation layer and have everything available from there. What to do: write down every difference between Cygwin and MSYS2 runtimes (see the patches ) offer appropriate patches to Cygwin as configurable behavior (e.g. CYGWIN=winsymlinks:copy) design an interface prototype for unacceptable features; figure out if the idea is sound design and implement the plug-in interface in cooperation with Cygwin re-implement MSYS2 runtime as a Cygwin plugin figure out if we can use Cygwin package repositories or if MSYS2 repositories can be used from Cygwin Links: https://github.com/Alexpux/Cygwin/commit/4f756d6cc28179319ceccce01dd698de3f22c212 https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/mailman/mingw-w64-public/thread/2F9017D3-8357-48C2-B887-A32FDF4E2141@gmail.com/ http://sourceware.org/ml/cygwin/2014-12/msg00084.html https://github.com/Alexpux/MSYS2-packages/issues/83 Connect with upstreams Where possible, we shouldn't maintain a bunch of patches, but rather polish them and have them accepted by upstreams. Another change to consider is to start building only release versions of the core packages. Although MSYS2 is a rolling release distro, there seems to be little need to use less tested, potentially more buggy code directly from git. If there's a really important, not yet realeased patch, we apply it in the PKGBUILD until the next release. Currently the mingw-w64 toolchains are the most prominent examples. switch to release versions of upstream code improve technical quality of packages (make sure they follow all the packaging rules, tests are succeeding) send ideas and patches upstream, be prepared to compromise Connect with downstreams Altough we are probably not so big among end-users yet, a lot of cross-platform developers know about MSYS2 and support it and even some big projects use it for their official builds. Some applications and environments use MSYS2 internally. We should get in touch with them and help them (it is, after all, one of the core goals of the project).

Some contributors become pretty active and motivated from time to time, but often they burn out after a while. Since there are so few of core people, the occasional interested users, contributors and issue reporters are often greeted by silence and turned off. What to do to get them: respond to them on IRC, Gitter, ML, handle their bug reports and contributions on GitHub in a timely fashion good documentation helps with frequent inquiries, automated checks help with code reviews get money and pay people? other ideas? Links: https://www.msys2.org/wiki/Contributing-to-MSYS2/ Fix pacman errors wrt. conflicts in bin/foo vs bin/foo.exe The runtime emulates extension-less executables by also looking for .exe on various FS calls. (There are more of these hacks, for example for symlink emulation.) This is causing pacman to complain when two packages independently provide both foo and foo.exe , or even worse dir/ and dir.exe . People have to either disregard these conflicts with --force or (re-)install packages in a specific order. A possible solution to these conflicts would be to disable the .exe interpolation, but then something would break, either users wouldn't be able to either run MSYS2 executables directly from Windows, or couldn't use the short extension-less names of commands in MSYS2.

Cygwin tries to bring a POSIX-compatible environment to Windows so that most software that runs on unices will build and run on Cygwin without any significant modifications. Cygwin provides a large collection of packages containing such software, and libraries for their development. MSYS2 tries to provide an environment for building native Windows software. MSYS2 provides a large collection of packages containing such software, and libraries for their development. As a large portion of the software uses GNU build tools which are tightly coupled to the unix world, this environment is also POSIX-compatible, and is in fact based on Cygwin. MSYS2 provides a minimal shell required to run autotools and other build systems which get the source for software from the Internet from different repositories, configure them and build them. The shell and core tools exist mainly to allow porting Unix programs to run natively on Windows (i.e. without requiring a POSIX emulation layer). MSYS2 doesn't try to duplicate Cygwin's efforts more than necessary, so the number of provided POSIX-emulated software is very small. Packages MSYS2 uses Pacman (known from Arch Linux) to manage its packages and comes with three different package repositories: msys2 : Containing MSYS2-dependent software mingw64 : Containing 64-bit native Windows software (compiled with mingw-w64 x86_64 toolchain) mingw32 : Containing 32-bit native Windows software (compiled with mingw-w64 i686 toolchain) Cygwin comes only with Cygwin-dependent software. It uses its own package management system, commonly called setup.exe. Runtime Cygwin provides a runtime library called cygwin1.dll that provides the POSIX compatibility layer where necessary. The MSYS2 variant of this library is called msys-2.0.dll and includes the following changes to support using native Windows programs: Automatic path mangling of command line arguments and environment variables to Windows form on the fly. (This can be selectively turned off .) Ability to change the reported OS using an environment variable ( MSYSTEM , with values of MSYS2 , MINGW32 , and MINGW64 ). This allows mingw-w64 software to be built in native build mode (as opposed to cross-compilation mode). Conversion of output of native Windown applications from Windows line endings to POSIX line endings by removing trailing '\\r' characters, so that e.g. bb=$(gcc --print-search-dirs) works as expected. Replacement of symlinks with copying, so that Windows programs don't trip up on these files. MSYS2 also supports creating native NTFS symlinks, but these are limited in other ways. Removal of the /cygdrive prefix for automounts. This is to retain compatibility with MSYS-enabled software that makes assumptions about /c/ being equivalent to C:/ , and it saves a bit of typing.

Downloading MSYS2 ships in the form of installers and base archives. They can be installed or extracted to any place on your computer, but you MUST use folder names that consist of only ascii characters and no spaces (also it makes good sense to put it in a path that doesn't use many characters due to PATH_MAX being 260; C:\\msys32 or C:\\msys64 is ideal). You can download the installers or base MSYS2 archives from the links below: 32-bit 64-bit Note: if you are using 64-bit Windows, there is no reason to use 32-bit MSYS2. Well, to be honest, there is one reason: you want to develop MSYS2 software (or contribute to MSYS2-packages) and want to test that the software/package also works on 32-bit MSYS2. When it comes to native software, 64-bit MSYS2 can be used to build, install and run both 32-bit and 64-bit variants. 64-bit MSYS2 software (practically speaking) never needs to be \"re-based\", giving a better user experience. II. Installation The installers and base archives only contain the tools necessary to 1) start MSYS2 2) update the pre-installed packages and 3) install new packages. After installing or extracting MSYS2 you should start MSYS2 by executing msys2_shell.cmd . (if you did not use an installer and this is first time running of MSYS2 after unpacking, then at this point it will create the files and settings necessary for it to function properly. After this initial run you MUST restart MSYS2 so that the settings are correct) Now you can update the base MSYS2 packages to their latest versions. MSYS2 comes with a ported version of the [Pacman][1] package manager (known from Arch Linux). III. Updating packages Partial upgrades (e.g. updating just pacman while not updating msys2-runtime ) are not supported and are expected to break stuff. Since pacman 5.0.1.6403, you can just: Run pacman -Syuu . Follow the instructions. Repeat this step until it says there are no packages to update. Since pacman 4.2.1.6187, there's an update-core script that helps you to update MSYS2 in the right way. To update your MSYS2 installation you need: Run update-core . If one of the packages is updated during script run you MUST restart MSYS2 Run pacman -Suu to update the rest of the packages (allowing downgrades). In older MSYS2 installations, follow these steps: Before updating you should synchronize your local package databases with the latest repositories: pacman -Sy This command connects to the remote repositories and downloads the package databases. The next step is to update the installed packages (do this initially and as often as you want thereafter): The 'normal' way ( don't do this ) would be to simply issue: pacman -Suu ... however, because all MSYS2 programs share the same address space for DLLs due to how MSYS2 (well, Cygwin) implements 'fork', updating bash, MSYS2 or Pacman itself can cause subsequent package updates to fail. For this reason, the safest procedure for updating MSYS2 is to do it in two stages; first those 'core' MSYS2 packages: pacman --needed -S bash pacman pacman-mirrors msys2-runtime ... if any packages got updated during this then you MUST restart MSYS2 because files that are provided by these packages will be in use and after update you can get fork errors - you need to exit all MSYS2 shells (and if using MSYS2 32bit, run autorebase.bat) then re-launch msys2_shell.bat Finally you can do an update of the remaining packages by issuing: pacman -Suu IV. General Package Management Installing new packages: pacman -S <package_names|package_groups> For example, pacman -S make gettext base-devel In this example is a package group which contains many packages. If you try to install a package group, Pacman will ask you whether you want to install one package from the group or all of the packages from the group.

Issues and workarounds Please read \"III.\" above, carefully :-) We will continue working towards trouble-free updates. If you do run into failures to run post-install scripts, it's really nothing to panic about. Simply make a list of the packages that failed to install correctly, exit all your MSYS2 shells (make sure that they fully exit and no mintty/bash processes are running). Then launch a new MSYS2 shell, and issue: pacman -S <list-of-packages-that-failed-to-install> If you get error: failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies) complaining about msys2-runtime-devel when you try to update the core, you need to update this package alongside msys2-runtime and the other core packages. Sometimes a package upgrade fails with failed to commit transaction (conflicting files) and some-pkg: /path/to/some/file exists in filesystem . If you're sure you didn't put the offending files there manually, move or delete the files and start the upgrade again. If your MSYS2 is unable to start after an upgrade, it's possible you just have some lingering MSYS2 processes (loaded with an older version of the runtime) that are conflicting with the processes you're trying to start. Hunt down these processes in your favorite task manager and kill them, or just reboot your system.

Issues and workarounds"},{"location":"wiki/MSYS2-introduction/","text":"MSYS2 is software distribution and a building platform for Windows. It provides a Unix-like environment, a command-line interface and a software repository making it easier to install, use, build and port software on Windows. That means Bash, Autotools, Make, Git, GCC, GDB..., all easily installable through Pacman, a fully-featured package manager. It is an independent rewrite of MSys, based on modern Cygwin (POSIX compatibility layer) and MinGW-w64 with the aim of better interoperability with native Windows software. Both 32-bit and 64-bit variants exist and receive mostly the same level of support. Subsystems MSYS2 consists of three subsystems and their corresponding package repositories, msys2 , mingw32 , and mingw64 . The mingw subsystems provide native Windows programs and are the main focus of the project. These programs are built to co-operate well with other Windows programs, independently of the other subsystems. This part builds on the MinGW-w64 project. The msys2 subsystem provides an emulated mostly-POSIX-compliant environment for building software, package management, and shell scripting. These programs live in a virtual single-root filesystem (the root is the MSYS2 installation directory). Some effort is made to have the programs work well with native Windows programs, but it's not seamless. This part builds on the Cygwin project. Each of the subsystems provides its own native (i.e. target=host ) compiler toolchain, in mingw-w64-i686-toolchain , and mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain . There are also cross compiler toolchains with host={i686,x86_64}-pc-msys and target={i686,x86_64}-w64-mingw32 in mingw-w64-cross-toolchain , but these are of limited use because there are no library packages for them. Shells Every subsystem has an associated \"shell\", which is essentially a set of environment variables that allow the subsystems to co-operate properly. These shells can be invoked using launchers in the MSYS2 installation directory or using the shortcuts in the Windows Start menu. The launchers set the MSYSTEM variable and open a terminal window ( mintty ) with a proper shell ( bash ). Bash in turn sources /etc/profile which sets the environment depending on the value of MSYSTEM . Without the correct environment, various things may and will (sometimes silently) break. The exception is using mingw subsystems from pure Windows, which shouldn't require any special environment apart from an entry in PATH . Do not set MSYSTEM outside of the shells, because that will also break things. PATH For optimal usage, MSYS2 automatically strips your PATH environment variable, essentially only leaving C:\\Windows\\System32 and few others. This behavior can be controlled by setting the variable MSYS2_PATH_TYPE before starting a shell or using a correct argument when executing the launcher script. Beware that mixing in programs from other MSYS2 installations, Cygwin installations, compiler toolchains or even various other programs is not supported and will probably break things in unexpected ways. Do not have these things in PATH when running MSYS2 unless you know what you're doing. Use msys2 shell for running pacman , makepkg , makepkg-mingw and for building POSIX-dependent software that you don't intend to distribute. Use mingw shells for building native Windows software and other tasks. Packages MSYS2 uses a port of pacman (known from Arch Linux) for package management. This brings many powerful features such as dependency resolution and simple complete system upgrades, as well as providing the build system ( makepkg-mingw ) - which is used to make these packages. Packages for msys2 are built from recipes in the msys2-packages Git repository, packages for mingw are in mingw-packages . Official repositories are on GitHub under user the msys2 organization. When looking for msys2 packages or deciding to create a new one, keep in mind that MSYS2 doesn't intend to compete with Cygwin or duplicate their efforts. The set of things that belong to the msys2 subsystem is pretty small and needs to stay that way. You might be wondering why there appears to be only one architecture variant of the msys2 repository. In reality there are two, but the decision about which one to use is made at the time you install it, depending on whether you installed the i686 or the x86_64 version. It is possible to install both if you wish. Actually, you can have multiple installations of each on your computer, but you should never run programs from two different MSYS2 XXbit variants at the same time due to DLL address space and version conflicts.

The latter one is called mingw32-make on command line, is fully native and doesn't depend on msys2 shells. The downside is that it doesn't work with many Makefile s. Unless you know what you're doing, use the regular make . Detecting version of MSYS from GNU make You can use the following Makefile snippet to detect whether you are running GNU make from an MSYS or an MSYS2 shell. If you run it through mingw32-make.exe from cmd.exe you will likely get an error since uname will not be found on your PATH . If you run it through mingw32-make.exe from one of the MSYS shells, it will set msys_version to 1 or 2 as appropriate. On any other system with uname present, it will set it to 0. msys_version := $(if $(findstring Msys, $(shell uname -o)),$(word 1, $(subst ., ,$(shell uname -r))),0) $(info The version of MSYS you are running is $(msys_version) (0 meaning not MSYS at all)) Platform checks You may need to use platform checks to switch between behaviour suited for MSYS2 and the default one. Some useful identifiers: Identifier Platform(s) Usage _WIN32 mingw, msvc C code ( #ifdef ... ) _WIN64 64-bit mingw, 64-bit msvc C code ( #ifdef ... ) __CYGWIN__ msys2, cygwin C code ( #ifdef ... ) __MSYS__ msys2 C code ( #ifdef ... ) x86_64-pc-msys2 64-bit msys2 Build scripts ( if [ $host = '...' ] ) i686-pc-msys2 32-bit msys2 Build scripts ( if [ $host = '...' ] ) x86_64-w64-mingw32 64-bit mingw Build scripts ( if [ $host = '...' ] ) i686-w64-mingw32 32-bit mingw Build scripts ( if [ $host = '...' ] ) cygwin msys2 Python ( sys.platform ) win32 mingw Python ( sys.platform ) Filesystem namespaces In MSYS2 there are two different filesystem namespaces in play. If you are building purely msys2 software, you can ignore the Windows filesystem namespace entirely, however, when building native software using MSYS2's tools, you must be mindful that when msys2 executes a native program, it will translate environment variables and command arguments from msys2-form to native-form. To do this, it converts things that look like msys2 paths. Sometimes it gets this wrong, e.g.: command.exe /switch Explanation: /switch is a Windows style switch. Note that Windows programs commonly accept unambiguous dash-prefixed switches ( -switch ) as well. adb push readme.txt /sdcard/0/ Explanation: /sdcard/0/ is a path on a foreign system. ./configure --root=/ Explanation: The value of root ( / ) is emitted to a text file via echo (which is an msys2 program and hence not mangled) and also to a Makefile (through autotools) which passes it to a native program, which reads the text file replacing each instance of / with \"some-other-path\". This will go wrong as / passed to the native program was converted to e.g. C:/msys64/ and therefore the necessary substitutions did not happen. [last sentence needs review or rewording] To work around this, path conversion can be selectively disabled. MSYS2 reads an environment variable called MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL . This is a ; delimited string each part of which is compared against the front part of each argument and if a match is found, that conversion is skipped. An example of a value for MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL that would inhibit path transformations of the 3 cases above is /switch;/sdcard;--root= . Setting MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL=* prevents any path transformation. The development repository for this path conversion code is https://github.com/Alexpux/path_convert . If you find a case that you think is unambiguously being converted incorrectly, please raise an issue there and/or a pull request with the broken test-case. Hard-coded paths and relocation When installing MSYS2, the user selects the root folder. POSIX software has a habit of baking the installation paths into the packages at build time, which is okay for msys2 software (which only sees the single-root virtual filesystem), but usually causes failures in native software. When a program tries to load its data files using these absolute paths on another MSYS2 installed to a different root folder, it won't find them. For this reason, adding path relocation patches is a common necessity for mingw packages (but never for msys2 packages). The point is to find the path where the program's executable resides, cutting off the /bin from the end and finding all necessary files using paths relative to that. Since this is a pretty common task and is not exactly trivial to get it right for all cases, we wrote some re-usable C code for that, available at https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/tree/master/mingw-w64-pathtools . Sometimes these paths are baked into shell scripts or pkg-config's .pc files. In that case, you should use sed in the PKGBUILD package() function to correct this back to the msys2 version of the path. [please review last sentence] An example of this can be seen at https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/blob/e0280472a1912cfcd9e714f6e0d06c407326e0df/mingw-w64-libtool/PKGBUILD#L79 . C *printf Format Specifier issues The vc6.0 msvcrt.dll that MinGW-w64 targets doesn't implement support for the ANSI standard format specifiers. MinGW-w64 works around this by providing their own implementation. To enable this you should pass -D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO=1 to the MinGW-w64 C and C++ compilers. All of our C/C++ packages are built with this flag. Different size of struct timeval The Windows (and thus mingw-w64) struct timeval is defined as having two long members, while the POSIX specs say it's supposed to have one time_t and one suseconds_t member. This means that on 64-bit, the size of the struct will be different from what you would expect on Linux/Cygwin/MSYS2. struct timeval on MSDN struct timeval on OpenGroup.org More 32/64 bit peculiarities Sorting out the stat thing by LRN: https://archive.li/IsgPq (Original URL - now down: https://gnunet.org/sorting-out-stat-thing ) Calling conventions, stdcall, and autotools Details about Windows' 32bit calling conventions: http://www.willus.com/mingw/yongweiwu_stdcall.html Problems stdcall causes with autotool's AC_CHECK_FUNC and AC_SEARCH_LIBS: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2013-05/msg00090.html Macro/inline function and autotools AC_CHECK_FUNCS and friends can't deal with function macros and static inline functions (because the checking code tries to #undef the symbol, doesn't include any headers and declares the symbol as extern instead). Possible solution is replacing them with more elaborate checks using AC_LINK_IFELSE or AC_COMPILE_IFELSE . For example this: AC_CHECK_FUNCS ( [ localtime_r ] , [ AM_CONDITIONAL([HAVE_LOCALTIME_R ] , true ) ] , [ AM_CONDITIONAL([HAVE_LOCALTIME_R ] , false ) ] ) ... can be replaced with this: AC_MSG_CHECKING ([ for localtime_r ]) AC_LINK_IFELSE ([ AC_LANG_PROGRAM ([[ #include <time.h> ]], [[ time_t t ; struct tm r ; localtime_r ( & t , & r ); ]])], [ AC_MSG_RESULT ([ yes ]) AM_CONDITIONAL ([ HAVE_LOCALTIME_R ], true ) AC_DEFINE ([ HAVE_LOCALTIME_R ], [ 1 ], [ Define to 1 if you have the ` localtime_r ' function or macro .])], [ AC_MSG_RESULT ([ no ]) AM_CONDITIONAL ([ HAVE_LOCALTIME_R ], false )]) Don't forget to autoreconf -fi after patching configure.ac . A tidy workaround from flameeyes for asprintf/vasprintf (but generally applicable): https://mailman.videolan.org/pipermail/vlc-devel/2015-March/101802.html Guarded time functions, ANSI format specifiers Some things in mingw-w64 are (maybe unexpectedly) guarded by #ifdef s. Check out _POSIX_C_SOURCE , __USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO , the time.h file. Note that (at the time of writing) pthread.h contains some defines that affect the definitions in time.h . Undefined references and linking to DLLs/SOs [this section may contain misinformations; it needs review from a knowledgeable person] Linux/ELF platforms generally don't do anything special to link to shared objects, they just leave the undefined references in the binary. Windows however requires all references to be resolved at link time. In case of DLLs, this is solved by the .dll.a import libraries that add the relevant .dll to the binary's import table and insert correct calls into the code, but it needs that correct linker flags be passed when linking binaries. Note that the linker is aware of these files and will use them automatically when using the standard -l arguments, for example -lfoo will make the linker check for libfoo.dll.a and libfoo.a , in this order (unless specified otherwise). Libtool generally refuses to create DLLs unless -no-undefined is passed to the linker invocation ( library_la_LDFLAGS = -no-undefined ). See: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libtool/2007-04/msg00066.html Library prefixes mingw DLLs follow the convention of prefixing libraries with lib . This affects shared libraries ( .dll ), static object archives ( .a ), and DLL import libraries ( .dll.a ). Because msys2 DLLs are generally ABI-incompatible with everything from outside of msys2 , they are prefixed with msys2- instead. For completeness, we note that Cygwin DLLs are prefixed with cyg . [does libtool or the linker handle this automatically?] Standard streams in mintty mintty is primarily designed to be a good terminal emulator (in the POSIX sense of the word) and it works well with bash, ssh and other Cygwin/MSYS2 programs. Because native Windows console programs use a fundamentally different way of handling console input/output, mintty uses pipes to connect to their standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr). Unfortunately, this has the effect that isatty and similar APIs (used to check whether a stream is attached to an interactive console or a pipe/file) will return incorrect values for native programs running under mintty. One way of fixing this problem is to run native programs inside a real Windows console, hide the console and use the console API to communicate with the program. This approach has obvious disadvantages, but it's good enough. Actually, this is the way most Windows console emulators work (e.g. ConsoleZ, ConEmu). There is also a wrapper program called winpty that does exactly this and translates the I/O to/from standard terminal sequences which mintty understands. Running a program under winpty (by prefixing the command line with winpty ) will make the program think it is running interactively, but it will also break any special features depending on terminal sequences, possibly including colored text output and TUIs. MSYS2 includes wrappers for some affected programs, so that they will work correctly most of the time. Examples can be seen in packages containing REPLs (python3, lua, nodejs, ...). mintty issue #56 , original on Google Code winpty on GitHub Response files When passing arguments with absolute paths to native Windows programs (such as /mingw64/bin/gcc ), these paths get (in most cases) automatically converted by MSYS2 if they're in POSIX format. However, if you're passing these paths inside a file (e.g. a response file for GCC -- gcc @somefile ), they need to be pre-converted to Windows native format. discussion topic: gcc -I (eye) uses msys2 path or windows path?

To do this, it converts things that look like msys2 paths. Sometimes it gets this wrong, e.g.: command.exe /switch Explanation: /switch is a Windows style switch. Note that Windows programs commonly accept unambiguous dash-prefixed switches ( -switch ) as well. adb push readme.txt /sdcard/0/ Explanation: /sdcard/0/ is a path on a foreign system. ./configure --root=/ Explanation: The value of root ( / ) is emitted to a text file via echo (which is an msys2 program and hence not mangled) and also to a Makefile (through autotools) which passes it to a native program, which reads the text file replacing each instance of / with \"some-other-path\".

In regular GNU/Linux environments, people use sudo to perform administrative tasks on their system, e.g. installing and removing packages, editing system configuration.

How to get Sudo Since MSYS2 doesn't support all the things a classic Sudo needs (setuid? PAM?), we need a replacement. One such replacement that doesn't seem to suffer from horrible security flaws is win-sudo .

GUI (graphical, windowed) programs fall outside of the scope of this text. Note that this topic is not simple and there are many factors that can cause differences in observed behavior ( TERM , LANG , LC_* ...). The following information is our best understanding and our best attempt at explaining it. If the reader has any corrections or clarifications, please post to the mailing list. Note that where we say MSYS2 below, it usually denotes Cygwin as well. MSYS2 (more generally POSIX) and regular Windows (i.e. non-MSYS2 ones) console programs both use character streams to read data from the user and to display data to the user. If reading and writing simple text is the only thing a program does (i.e. it's not interactive), then the program's I/O should be easily portable between Windows, MSYS2 and other platforms. On a more advanced level, e.g. when a program employs a REPL or uses colored output or draws TUIs , the two systems are fundamentally different. MSYS2/POSIX programs use in-band terminal sequences , while Windows programs use out-of-band calls to the Windows Console API . In the POSIX world, REPLs are often programmed using the readline library and TUIs using the ncurses library. Terminals Terminals are programs that interface with console programs and facilitate their input (e.g. accept keypresses from the user and send corresponding characters to the program) and output (e.g. draw the characters from the programs as corresponding glyphs on the screen). Mintty is a terminal emulator built for MSYS2 programs. It provides the necessary POSIX interfaces to MSYS2 programs. There are other terminal emulators in Cygwin, but they're not provided in MSYS2. The Windows console ( conhost ) does the same for Windows programs. It provides the back-end to the Windows Console API. Shells A distinct category of programs is shells . A shell is the actual program that reads commands from the user and runs them. The \"DOS window\" in Windows is actually a combination of a Windows console and the Windows shell ( cmd , command line). Likewise, when you open a mintty window, you'll probably see the bash shell running inside and waiting for your commands. This matching is not mandatory though, as bash can be run in a Windows console and cmd can be run in mintty. Mixing MSYS2 and Windows MSYS2 allows some inter-operation between a MSYS2 program and Windows console and between a Windows program and MSYS2 terminal emulators. For basic stuff, it works fine. Anything more complicated, like colored text, TUIs and line editing , is a lottery -- it can work, it can break. Winpty is a wrapper program that works as a translator between Windows programs and MSYS2 terminals. It opens an invisible Windows console window and runs the wrapped program in it. It then relays input from the terminal to the program and output from the program to the terminal. This solves a lot of the issues of running Windows programs in a MSYS2 terminal.","title":"Terminals"},{"location":"wiki/Terminals/#terminals","text":"Terminals are programs that interface with console programs and facilitate their input (e.g. accept keypresses from the user and send corresponding characters to the program) and output (e.g. draw the characters from the programs as corresponding glyphs on the screen).
