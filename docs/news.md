### 2020-10-08 - main repo pruned

Due to limited space on the new server and SourceForge file hosting, we are
starting to remove older unused packages from the archives.  There should still
be a 1 year's worth of packages available for downgrades.  Mirrors are free to
choose whether they want to keep everything or follow the lead.


### 2020-10-07 - server downtime

From Friday 2nd to Wednesday 10th, the main hosting at repo.msys2.org was down.
The server unfortunately completely died and the hosting had to be moved
elsewhere.  We thank Diablo-D3 for having provided the hardware and hosting.  If
you notice anything wrong with repo.msys2.org since the move, please tell us.


### 2020-06-29 - new packagers

Alexey is stepping down from his role as the main packager and two new packagers
have been appointed in his place:

- David Macek with [signing key 0x9078f532](http://keys.gnupg.net/pks/lookup?search=0x87771331B3F1FF5263856A6D974C8BE49078F532&fingerprint=on&op=vindex)
- Christoph Reiter with [signing key 0xa0aa7f57](http://keys.gnupg.net/pks/lookup?search=0x5F944B027F7FE2091985AA2EFA11531AA0AA7F57&fingerprint=on&op=vindex)

You can see the keys in full without relying on keyservers in the [msys2-keyring
GitHub repository](https://github.com/msys2/MSYS2-keyring/).

We have released a new *msys2-keyring* package from that source (and a new
installer that includes them) and we are waiting for a bit before uploading new
databases and packages to give people time to update.  If you don't update the
keyring in time, you'll see something like this:

```
:: Synchronizing package databases...

error: mingw64: signature from "David Macek <david.macek.0@gmail.com>" is marginal trust
error: msys: signature from "David Macek <david.macek.0@gmail.com>" is marginal trust
```

We have prepared the following steps to verify and install the new keyring
manually after which you should be able to use `pacman -Syu` again:

```
$ curl -O http://repo.msys2.org/msys/x86_64/msys2-keyring-r21.b39fb11-1-any.pkg.tar.xz
$ curl -O http://repo.msys2.org/msys/x86_64/msys2-keyring-r21.b39fb11-1-any.pkg.tar.xz.sig

$ pacman-key --verify msys2-keyring-r21.b39fb11-1-any.pkg.tar.xz.sig
==> Checking msys2-keyring-r21.b39fb11-1-any.pkg.tar.xz.sig... (detached)
gpg: Signature made Mon Jun 29 07:36:14 2020 CEST
gpg:                using DSA key AD351C50AE085775EB59333B5F92EFC1A47D45A1
gpg: Good signature from "Alexey Pavlov (Alexpux) <alexpux@gmail.com>" [full]

# pacman -U msys2-keyring-r21.b39fb11-1-any.pkg.tar.xz
```

If you can't even import the key and the above command fails like this:

```
error: msys: key "4A6129F4E4B84AE46ED7F635628F528CF3053E04" is unknown
:: Import PGP key 4A6129F4E4B84AE46ED7F635628F528CF3053E04? [Y/n]
[...]
error: database 'msys' is not valid (invalid or corrupted database (PGP signature))
loading packages...
error: failed to prepare transaction (invalid or corrupted database)
```

... you have to convince pacman to not care about those databases for a while,
for example like this:

```
# pacman -U --config <(echo) msys2-keyring-r21.b39fb11-1-any.pkg.tar.xz
```

If you still see signature errors, resetting your pacman key store might help:

```
# rm -r /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/
# pacman-key --init
# pacman-key --populate msys2
```


### 2020-06-15 - New `base` metapackage; `pacman-contrib` is now separate

Following a similar change in Arch Linux, the `base` group was replaced with
a `base` metapackage.  If you installed your MSYS2 using an installer older than
2020-06-02, please run `pacman -S base` to get up to date.

This also installs the `pacman-contrib` package where `updpkgsums`, `pactree`
etc. now live (previously included in the `pacman` package).

Details at [#1979](https://github.com/msys2/MSYS2-packages/pull/1979),
[#1976](https://github.com/msys2/MSYS2-packages/issues/1976) and
[#1988](https://github.com/msys2/MSYS2-packages/pull/1988).


### 2020-05-31 - Update may fail with "could not open file"

In case your update process errors out with something similar to

> error: could not open file /var/cache/pacman/pkg/zstd-1.4.5-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst: Child process exited with status 127

update pacman separately first:

```
pacman -Sydd pacman
```

This issue is caused by a pacman version that is too old and can't handle newer
packages compressed with zstd. In case you are seeing this problem in CI
consider using a newer base which contains a newer pacman which supports zstd:
https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases


### 2020-05-22 - MSYS2 may fail to start after a msys2-runtime upgrade

MSYS2 programs will fail to start if programs started before the update are
still running in the background (especially sshd, dirmngr, gpg-agent, bash,
pacman and mintty). You can stop them by running the following in a Windows
terminal:

```batch
taskkill /f /fi "MODULES eq msys-2.0.dll"
```

If that fails, try a reboot.

We've improved our update process so this shouldn't happen again with future
updates.


### 2020-05-22 - Pacman may fail to install packages with `Unrecognized archive format`

For a while, the core packages were prematurely packaged using zstd without
giving users time to update to zstd-enabled pacman first.  This should be
resolved now.


### 2020-05-17 - 32-bit MSYS2 no longer actively supported

32-bit mingw-w64 packages are still supported, this is about the POSIX emulation
layer, i.e. the runtime, Bash, MinTTY...

After this date, we don't plan on building updated msys-i686 packages nor
releasing i686 installers anymore.  This is due to increasingly frustrating
difficulties with limited 32-bit address space, high penetration of 64-bit
systems and Cygwin (our upstream) starting their way to drop 32-bit support as
well.


### 2019-06-03 - mingw-w64 Ada and ObjC unsupported until further notice

Pacman may say this when updating:

```
looking for conflicting packages...
error: failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies)
:: installing mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc (9.1.0-1) breaks dependency 'mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc=8.3.0-2' required by mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-ada
:: installing mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc (9.1.0-1) breaks dependency 'mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc=8.3.0-2' required by mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-objc
:: installing mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc (9.1.0-1) breaks dependency 'mingw-w64-i686-gcc=8.3.0-2' required by mingw-w64-i686-gcc-ada
:: installing mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc (9.1.0-1) breaks dependency 'mingw-w64-i686-gcc=8.3.0-2' required by mingw-w64-i686-gcc-objc
```

Ada and ObjC are currently unsupported in MSYS2 builds due to long-standing
issues with the i686 variant.  Run
`pacman -R mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-ada mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-objc` and/or
`pacman -R mingw-w64-i686-gcc-ada mingw-w64-i686-gcc-objc`, then update.


### 2016 - Core update integrated into Pacman; `update-core` removed

The function of `update-core` is transferred to `pacman -Syuu`.


### 2016 - Command window may linger after startup

Change the argument `/K` to `/C` in all three Start menu shortcuts.
