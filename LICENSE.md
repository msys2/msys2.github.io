For historical reasons the license of the website content isn't very clear. The
content under `web/wiki` was initially maintained in a Sourceforge wiki, then in
a GitHub wiki and then it was imported into this repo, and doesn't have a
license.

Any content added after 2023-03-03 is licensed under the following terms:

* The website content is licensed under [CC-BY-SA-4.0](./licenses/CC-BY-SA-4.0.txt)
* All code samples are licensed under [CC0-1.0](./licenses/CC0-1.0.txt)
* Everything else, like code/configuration/templates/stylesheets and similar, that are used for building and maintaining the website is licensed under [BSD-3-Clause](./licenses/BSD-3-Clause.txt)

The same is true for all content by the following authors independent of when it
was added:

* Christoph Reiter (<https://github.com/lazka>)
* David Macek (<https://github.com/elieux>)

This of course does not apply to any content that is explicitly licensed under
different licenses.
