For historical reasons the license of the website content isn't very clear.

The content under `web/wiki` was initially maintained in a Sourceforge wiki,
then in a GitHub wiki and then it was imported into this repo, and doesn't have a license.

Any content added after 2023-03-03 is licensed under the
[BSD-3-Clause](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html) license.

The same is true for everything added by the following authors independent of
when it was added:

* Christoph Reiter <https://github.com/lazka>

This of course does not apply to any content that is explicitly licensed under
different licenses, like `codeofconduct.md` for example.
